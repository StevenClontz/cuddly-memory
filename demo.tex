% This is a simple sample document.  For more complicated documents take a look in the exercise tab. Note that everything that comes after a % symbol is treated as comment and ignored when the code is compiled.

\documentclass{article} % \documentclass{} is the first command in any LaTeX code.  It is used to define what kind of document you are creating such as an article or a book, and begins the document preamble

\usepackage{amsmath} % \usepackage is a command that allows you to add functionality to your LaTeX code
\usepackage{amssymb}

\title{My class example} % Sets article title
\author{Steven Clontz} % Sets authors name
\date{2023-09-22} % Sets date for date compiled

% The preamble ends with the command \begin{document}
\begin{document} % All begin commands must be paired with an end command somewhere
\maketitle % creates title using information in preamble (title, author, date)

\section{Hello World!} % creates a section

\textbf{Hello World!} Today I am learning \LaTeX.
It is 100\% better than Word. %notice how the command will end at the first non-alphabet charecter such as the . after \LaTeX
\LaTeX{} is a great program for writing math.
I can write in line math such as $a^2+b^2=c^2$ %$ tells LaTexX to compile as math
. I can also give equations their own space:
\begin{equation} \label{myWorseEquation} % Creates an equation environment and is compiled as math 
  x+1=x^2+1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{myEquation} % Creates an equation environment and is compiled as math 
  \gamma^2+\theta^2=\omega^2
\end{equation}
$$
  x^2+y^2=z^2
$$
\[
  \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
If I do not leave any blank lines \LaTeX{} will continue
this text without making it into a new paragraph. Notice
that Equation \ref{myEquation} got a number.




Notice how there was no indentation
in the text after equation \ref{myEquation}.
Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence
and here $\downarrow$
\LaTeX{} formats the sentence without any break.
Also   look  how      it   doesn't     matter
how    many  spaces     I put     between       my    words.

For a new essay I can leave a blank space in my code.

\section{Hello World again!} % creates a section

Hey y'all.


\section{Hello World one more time!} % creates a section

My third section.

\section{Bye World!} % creates a section

One last thing.
\end{document} % This is the end of the document
